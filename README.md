# NumberGuessingGame — Console App in C#

This is a simple console app written in C# as part of a homework assignment in C# where the player guesses a number.  
The game offers two modes: a casual range (1-100) and a custom range defined by the user.

## About

This project helped me practice:  
- Console input/output and interaction in C#  
- Using loops, conditionals, and exception handling  
- Basic program structure with methods and switch-case  
- Generating random numbers and validating user input  

## Features

- Text-based menu with options to select game mode or exit  
- Casual game: guess a number between 1 and 100  
- Custom game: user sets the range of numbers to guess from  
- Input validation with feedback on invalid input  
- Informing the user if their guess is too high or too low  
- Counting attempts and showing the number of tries upon success  

## Future Improvements

- Validate custom range inputs to prevent logical errors  
- Add difficulty levels or attempt limits  
- Implement a scoring or leaderboard system  
- Refactor into multiple classes for cleaner architecture  

## Technologies

- .NET Framework 4.7.2  
- C#  
- Console Application

This app is a simple yet effective exercise in C# console programming. It’s far from perfect but fully functional — done is better than perfect! As they say at least...
